                <p> Java isn’t a difficult programming language if you understand its syntax and concepts clearly and implement them in real-time projects. It has been in the industry for more than 28+ years and is the most widely used programming language globally, which means you have consistent support from a large community and access to many resources available on the internet. This makes learning Java and implementing it in projects easy. </p>
                <p> As an open-source language, Python offers several features, libraries, and frameworks for developers to build small-scale projects. Moreover, if you write code in Java, you can run it on any operating system.</p>
                <p> As a beginner, learning Java can be a little challenging, and it requires hard work and determination to get better at it. Firstly, you need to learn OOP concepts and then understand verbose Java Syntax. Additionally, you need knowledge of databases, Version Control Systems, IDE, and more, which can be initially challenging. You can enroll in the right Java course or self-paced lectures that cover fundamental knowledge and use real-life scenarios for better understanding.</p>
