                <p> I feel joining an entry-level Java full-stack development job is beneficial for freshers because of a different reason as well. You not only get to learn from industry experts but also earn money during this period. By sitting at home and watching YouTube videos, you won’t get the required knowledge to work on real-time projects that your seniors in the company can provide. </p>
                <p> Additionally, entry-level jobs help you build credibility and reputation in the market so that you can land better job opportunities in the future. They show that you have real-life experiences, which can have a positive impact on your development project plans.</p>

                <p><b>Javascript:</b> This is an interesting programming language, as you can use it for both client-side and server-side developments. For back-end programming requirements, I recommend you to learn Node.js and Express.js frameworks, while for front-end development, you can learn popular frameworks and libraries built with JavaScript, such as ReactJS, Vue, jQuery, and Angular. Otherwise, you can also learn Hibernate and Spring frameworks for back-end development.</p>

                <p>Java build tools like Maven and Gradle are essential for first-time developers, and they can streamline the development process and enhance project management. These tools can automate critical tasks like building processes, dependency management, compilation, and testing of codes. </p>

            <>
                <p>Both JavaServer Pages or JSP and Servlets are essential for Java web development. These technologies enable server-side rendering and processing of web requests in Java applications. JSP helps in embedding Java code within HTML, allowing dynamic content generation, while Servlets provide a powerful way to handle HTTP requests and responses. JavaServer Pages are an extended version of Java Servlets.</p>

                <p> I suggest all Java full-stack developers learn web technologies like REST APIs, AJAX, JSON, etc., for the development of single-page applications (SPAs) and progressive webpages (PWAs). REST uses the HTTP protocol to transfer data between the server and client sides. To create these REST APIs, you can use Spring Boot or Jersey. </p>
                <p> AJAX can be used to create asynchronous web applications. Libraries like jQuery or AngularJS are used to implement AJAX in Java projects.</p>
                <p> JSON is a simple, language-independent data format used to transmit data between servers and web applications. NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) can store JSON-like data.</p>

            <>
                <p> Java full-stack developers need to understand the basic concept of testing and debugging so that they can identify and solve bugs and issues early in the development phase. Some popular testing frameworks include JUnit, TestNG, Selenium, etc. JUnit and TestNG are suitable frameworks for unit testing; however, if you are testing a web application, I suggest you use Selenium. </p>
                <p> I have shared a few Java testing frameworks below for your understanding.</p>

                <p>The number of developers using automated testing tools is increasing every day. I followed the StackOverflow developers survey 2023 to find the most <Link className="link-color" to='https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-platform-prof'>  popular processes, tools, and programs</Link> developers use within an organisation. Here’s what I found: nearly 60.79% of developers are using automated testing in their companies; see the graph below:</p>

        title: "Can you become a Java full-stack developer with no experience?",
        intro: () => (
            <>
                <p> Yes, you can become a Java full-stack developer with no experience, but you need to enrol in a course, get proper training, and work on your individual project. </p>

                <p> If you complete a certification course from a reputed institution, you will get hands-on training on whatever you learn and the ability to create an attractive portfolio of good real-world projects. </p>

                <p> As a fresher, you might not have the required work experience to land a good job. Doing a course is good, but they might provide the same level of training to everyone. Therefore, to stand out from the competition, you can start developing your own individual projects and hosting them on free platforms.</p>

                <p> The Java full-stack developer course takes around 100 days or three months. At Codegnan, we provide Java full-stack developer training courses for 100 days, where our experts provide you with necessary theoretical concepts along with practical sessions after every module. You also get to work on real-life projects under the mentorship of top Java full-stack developers in the country.</p>

        intro: () => (
            <>
                <p>It takes 3-6 months to become a Java full-stack developer, but becoming an expert in the domain can take up to a year or more. This completely depends on your ability to grasp the concepts and implement them into real-life projects. You need to constantly upgrade yourself to stay updated with market trends and practice regularly to find better solutions to software development.</p>

                <p>If you want to become a good full-stack Java developer in a shorter time frame, you must put sufficient time and dedication into learning, practising regularly, and starting to gain industry experience through internship opportunities.</p>

                <p>Along with Java, you may also consider learning Python to upgrade your skill level. Here is the <Link className="link-color" to='/blog/python-course-syllabus/'> complete Python course syllabus </Link> to prepare your learning roadmap.</p>

            <>
                <p> If you have decided to pursue this career option further, you need to remember that nothing good happens over time. Find a good Java full-stack development course, get hands-on training under industry experts, apply for internships, and keep upskilling yourself.</p>

                <p> You need to stay updated with market trends, learn using new tools and technologies, and develop high-quality solutions. </p>

                <p> I suggest that you focus on one technology at a time. Learning front-end and back-end development, along with database management, can mess up the whole process. </p>
